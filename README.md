### Hello friend!

I'm an instructor 👩‍🏫, developer 💻, and just general coding fanatic 🤓

I've got way too many repositories and way too few friends who live near me and will play complicated board games with me (🥲)

I occassionally throw stuff [📝 here](https://www.codingmadeclear.com/) and [🎥 here](https://youtube.com/@codingmadeclear4970).
